1.) for this assignment you are going to modify you Gradebook application so that all of the data is stored in a file/set of files.   You have freedom
to set up how it is stored and make whatever assumptions you would like but part of the explanation will be to be able to identify the pros and cons
of the way you set it up vs other options.

2.) depending on how you set it up you may find that you want to change your existing classes slightly to add additional information and that is fine 

3.) the only thing you cant change is the Gradebook method signatures (what parameters get passed to each of the methods I originally gave you)  or in otherwords
the main Class should not change and it should still work.
